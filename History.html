  Elgin's histroy goes all the way back to a 9th century pictish stone<br>
  The first stone of the cathedral was placed on the 19th of July in 1224. It was completed in 1242 and quickly burned down in a fire in 1270. <br>
  You can still visit the ruins today.<br>
  many famous kings of scotland had lodgings in elgin including David I, William I, Alexander II and Alexander III. <br>
  Edward I of England visited Elgin in 1296 in which he kept a journal which you can still view in Elgin Library.<br>
  When Robert the Bruce retook Scotland after Edwards death he destoryed many castles including the caslte on top of lady hill which you can still visit the ruins of.

    <h1><u> Later History </u></h1>
    If you visit Roseisle beach you will find these big square stones (seen left) and concrete bunkers along the coast line.<br>
    These were anti tank obsticles from WW2, if ever there was a landing from the north these would hopefully slow down the german infantry.<br>
    There is also evidence of American and Canadian practice runs of D-Day landings near Burghead.<br>
